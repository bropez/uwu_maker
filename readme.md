# Description

Have you ever felt like whatever you wrote needs to be a little cuter? Yeah, me neither. So I wrote a script for it. 

Python script that takes text that is copied on the clipboard, changes the text to be more kawaii, and copies the new
text onto the clipboard. I'm not even sure why I made this script. Inspired by

created by <a href="https://twitter.com/leafysweets">leafysweetgarden</a>

# Getting Started

After getting the script you'll need to `pip install pyperclip` and you'll be ready to run this script

# Usage

Before running the script:

```
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
‘Tis but thy name that is my enemy:
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot
Nor arm nor face nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O be some other name.
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.
```

After running the script:

```
o womeo, womeo, whewefowe awt thou womeo?
deny thy fathew and wefushe thy name.
ow if thou wiwt not, be but shwown my wove
and i’ww no wongew be a capuwet.
‘tish but thy name that ish my enemy:
thou awt thyshewf, though not a montague.
what’sh montague? it ish now hand now foot
now awm now face now any othew pawt
bewonging to a man. o be shome othew name.
what’sh in a name? that which we caww a woshe
by any othew name wouwd shmeww ash shweet;
sho womeo wouwd, wewe he not womeo caww’d,
wetain that deaw pewfection which he owesh
without that titwe. womeo, doff thy name,
and fow that name, which ish no pawt of thee,
take aww myshewf.
```
